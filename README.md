# Hajj Package Helper

A small, local-only web app to help prospective hujjaj compare and evaluate Hajj packages
based on personal preferences and budget.

This project is built as a khidmah (service) effort.
No tracking. No accounts. No data leaves your device.

## What this app does
- Allows users to:
  - Set preferences (dates, Makkah zone, Mina camp, occupancy, budget)
  - Review available Hajj packages

  - Save up to 5 preferred packages
  - Get value-first recommendations with estimated totals

  except through the official Nusuk platform:
